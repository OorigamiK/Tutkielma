	Interval sum means summing elements in a row. It raises as a natural question how many interval sums are there. Our main theorem provides asymptotic for the number of interval sums. Asymptotic simply looks at the big picture while ignoring small bumps. One restriction of our theorem is that it only works for sequences that have growth similar to polynomial.
